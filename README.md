### Hi-Ho 
Here is just another Grumpy-Old-Men - cycling, hiking & coding

### How to contact me?
I am __not active__ on any social media - IMHO just a _waste of time_. If you want to get in touch, eMail is just fine.

### Have a project/repository related question or suggestion?
Please don't eMail me, asking: "_Will this work for me/my scenario?_" - I don't have a crystal ball.

There is pretty much __documented__ in the projects and I have invested quite an amount of time writing this. Please be so kind and spend some time _reading_ it - TIA.

Of course you are invited to ask your question in the _discussion_ section of each of my projects. Typically I will reply in less then 24h. Nevertheless, please understand that I am not able to provide support _on individual level_ via eMail. Probably I will ask you to get in contact with me (in case of an existing _issue_).
